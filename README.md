This repository demonstrates a common hydration mismatch error in Next.js 15.  The error occurs when data is fetched on the server-side and used to render a component that's also client-side rendered, leading to discrepancies between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side hydration process. The solution involves either fetching data on the client-side or using a data fetching method that's compatible with both server-side and client-side rendering.
